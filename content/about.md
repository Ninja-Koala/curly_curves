Hi, i'm NinjaKoala ðŸ‘‹

Some facts about me:
* Active member of the local Hackspace [Hasi](https://ha.si)
* Member of the demogroup [epoqe](https://epoqe.group)
* Studying math at the University of Siegen
* [Shadertoy](https://shadertoy.com) addict

In this blog i'm planning to write mainly on my findings on the intersection of math and computer graphics, like BÃ©zier curves.
Maybe i'll cover some rendering tricks and techniques and also some simple proofs related to those topics.
